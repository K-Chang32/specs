**Notice:** This is the official Filecoin protocol specification.
The goal of this document is to provide sufficient detail for other implementations to be fully compatible with [`go-filecoin`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin) peers, but this is still a work in progress.
If you notice any errors or discrepancies, please open an issue in the [specs repository](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs).
