# The Filecoin Spec

This repo contains the documents that comprise the Filecoin spec.

Every document in the top level of the repo is part of the official spec, and
is canon. Documents in the 'drafts' folder are work-in-progress draft documents
that aren't yet accepted as part of the spec, but exist here for discussion.
Documents in the notes repo are various notes from different meetings and
discussions.

### Gitbook viewing
The spec follows gitbook format, and can be viewed using the gitbook tooling.

To view, install `gitbook-cli` via npm and run:
```
gitbook serve
```

Alternatively, you can use gitbook to print a pdf using:
```
gitbook pdf
```

(Note: on macOS using the pdf printer may require some extra installation)

If you're just browsing on GitHub, start with [INTRO.md](INTRO.md) and the
table of contents in [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md). But really, prefer
the Gitbook output.

## Updates process for specs
