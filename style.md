# Style
Any content that is written with `code ticks` has a specific definition to Filecoin and is defined in [the glossary](definitions.md).

Many sections of the spec use go type notation to describe the functionality of certain components. This is entirely a style preference by the authors and does not imply in any way that one must use go to implement Filecoin. 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
